**EcoSpark** - *Combining sustainable goals and games*

Our game, unlike typical immersive experiences, focuses on addressing environmental issues that will worsen for the next generation. Through mini-games like quizzes, fact-reading, and an OpenCV module to detect light bulbs, our educational app encourages small, impactful daily habits. Join us in shaping a sustainable future by engaging young minds today. It suitable for age for all age groups starting from 9 and above. 
The project though in its development phase, the project provides wonderful and carefully selected information that is suiatble  and relevant all while making it ineractive and easy to use.
